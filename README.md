# Project Title

This is a simple Hello World program to introduce students to basic programming in Javascript

## Getting Started

Pasting the code snippet to the the browser console panel will print out basic Hello messages

### Prerequisites

Any browsers would work but it is recommended to use Google Chrome 

### How To Get Around

Every browser has a different way of accessing the console, which is usually the easiest to test out some Javascript code

In Chrome, right click on a page and select **Inspect** or press the key combination Ctrl/Command + Shift + I

Within the **Console** tab of the Developer Console, try the following commands out and press **Return** or **Enter** key

```
console.log ('Hello World');
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
